Have a wonderful day

To run what we currently have, first install the python libs needed using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

the python version we use is python3 (so make relevant changes i.e pip3 etc)

If there are issues running pySpark, make sure you have the following env variables
$PYSPARK_PYTHON is set to where your python3 resides for me this was:
/usr/local/bin/python3

and $PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON is 
ipython3
